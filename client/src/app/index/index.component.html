        <h2 class="font-italic text-center text-info">The Pride of Connecticut</h2>
        <p>The roots of The University of Connecticut Marching Band date back to the formation of a military band of
            cadets in 1896. Composed of roughly fifteen musicians, the band consisted of all male students playing
            brass
            and percussion instruments. The 1915 band consisted of the Chief Musician, M.R. Young, Principal
            Musician,
            J.R. Chase, Drum Major, E.F. Farnham, as well as several Corporals, Sergeants, and Privates. Throughout
            the
            1920s, the band could regularly be seen leading a parade of students and alumni through campus to the
            football games.</p>
        <p>With growing popularity, the R.O.T.C. band increased their numbers into the thirties by 1932 with Richard
            Young as the Leader and Sidney Marland as Drum Major. However, there had been an increasing interest
            among
            students to create a volunteer student band that would be able to represent the entire school. On
            November
            6th, 1934, an editorial article in the campus newspaper discussed the possibility of creating such a
            band.
            However, a lack of resources and time required to train the band contributed to the idea folding for the
            time being.</p>
        <p>A new year gave new life to the creation of the “College Band.” In September of 1935, two juniors revived
            the
            proposal, and with the hiring of an additional staff member in the Music Department, the “College Band
            was
            created.” Herbert A. France became the first Director of the Band. The band sported preppy white
            sweaters
            with a blue lyre and block “C” as their uniform. Students gave enthusiastic support for the band, and
            with
            financial support from the Student Senate and Athletic Department, the band made their debut at the home
            football game versus Northeastern. That year, the band also performed at away football games at
            Wesleyan,
            Massachusetts State, and Rhode Island, as well as at all home basketball games. Sidney Rhein served as
            the
            Student Director and Band Master, Sidney Marland as band Leader, and Richard Barrell as Manager.</p>
